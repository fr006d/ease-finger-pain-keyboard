Ease Finger Pain Keyboard in Full.  
Essentially a touch keyboard you could ZX with lesser pain but for the iOS.

## Intro
Basically this is an application which did the same thing as Remote osu! Keyboard(https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/391981).  
But I don’t have an android phone, so I give it a try to make an iOS version of the touch keyboard so I don’t have to suffer more pain.
